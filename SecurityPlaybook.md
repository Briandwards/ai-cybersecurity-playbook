## 🔐 Best Practices

### 🔑 Password Security
- Enforce strong passwords (12+ characters, mix of types)
- Use a password manager (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password)
- Change default passwords on all devices

### 🔒 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
> AI-GENERATED EXPLANATION:
> “MFA adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second form of identity verification. Even if a hacker gets your password, they can’t access your account without the second factor — such as a code sent to your phone.”

### 🔄 Software Updates
- Turn on automatic updates for OS and software
- Regularly update antivirus and firewall tools

### 🌐 Network Security
- Use a business-grade router/firewall
- Disable unused ports and remote access protocols
- Separate guest and internal networks
