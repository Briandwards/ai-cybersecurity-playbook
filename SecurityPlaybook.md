## 1. Core Security Principles

### 1.1 Least Privilege
Users should only have the access they need to perform their duties.  
- Remove admin rights from daily accounts.  
- Create separate admin accounts for configuration tasks.

### 1.2 Patch Management
Unpatched software is one of the top causes of breaches.  
- Enable automatic updates for Windows, browsers, and key apps.  
- Schedule weekly update checks.

### 1.3 Backup & Recovery
Regular backups prevent ransomware losses.  
- Use **3-2-1 rule**: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite.  
- Test restores monthly.

### 1.4 Secure Configuration
Disable unnecessary services and default passwords.  
- Rename the default ‚ÄúAdministrator‚Äù account.  
- Disable Guest accounts.  
- Enforce password length and complexity policies.

### 1.5 User Awareness
Train employees to recognize phishing and social engineering.  
- Conduct quarterly training.  
- Send simulated phishing tests to improve awareness.
