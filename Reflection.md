#  Reflection on AI-Enhanced Cybersecurity Project

## Brainstorming Process
Initial AI brainstorming focused on ideas that:
- Deliver real business value  
- Are doable in one week  
- Showcase cybersecurity skills  

**AI Prompt Used:**
> “I am a CIS capstone student. I need to brainstorm a project idea that I can complete in one week, publish in a GitHub repo, and showcase in my job search portfolio. It should deliver business value, be technically impressive, use AI during development, and align with my career goal as a cybersecurity professional.”

**AI Suggestions:**
1. AI-assisted phishing detection rules  
2. Small business cybersecurity playbook  
3. Automated PowerShell security audit script  
4. Secure VPN configuration checklist  
5. CompTIA self-grading exam generator  

After evaluating feasibility and value, I selected **#2 and #3 combined** — the playbook plus automation script — because it was realistic, high-value, and visually professional.

---

## Why This Artifact
- Addresses a **real gap** for small organizations lacking cybersecurity staff.  
- Combines **technical skill** (PowerShell scripting, system checks) with **strategic communication** (policies and playbooks).  
- Aligns directly with **cybersecurity career goals**.

---

## What Worked
✅ AI accelerated content drafting and formatting.  
✅ PowerShell script was validated and tested with AI suggestions.  
✅ Markdown structure made GitHub publishing easy and professional.

---

## What Didn’t Work
⚠️ Some AI code output required debugging and syntax cleanup.  
⚠️ Overly generic security advice was refined manually to ensure relevance.  
⚠️ AI explanations sometimes repeated information; human editing improved clarity.

---

## Lessons Learned
- AI is a **strong assistant**, not a replacement for expertise.  
- Combining automation (script) and documentation (playbook) delivers maximum business value.  
- Markdown and GitHub presentation are key for professional impact.  

---

**Final Thought:**  
This project demonstrates how AI can empower cybersecurity professionals to create impactful, portfolio-ready tools that make security more accessible to small organizations.
