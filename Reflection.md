# 💭 Reflection: Using AI to Build a Cybersecurity Playbook

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project was to use AI to brainstorm, design, and create a cybersecurity artifact that delivers real business value and is suitable for inclusion in a professional portfolio.

As a CIS capstone student, I focused on creating a **cybersecurity playbook** tailored to **small businesses** — a high-risk group that often lacks security expertise. My artifact combines best practices, response templates, and checklists, all enhanced by AI.

## 🧠 Brainstorming with AI

### Initial Prompt:
> "I am a CIS capstone student. I need to brainstorm a project idea that I can complete in one week, publish in a GitHub repo, and showcase in my job search portfolio. It should deliver business value, be technically impressive, use AI during development, and align with my career goal in cybersecurity. Give me at least 5 project ideas..."

### AI-Generated Ideas:
- AI-generated phishing detection rules
- Secure network topology documentation
- Automated VPN setup checklist
- Cybersecurity playbook for small businesses ✅ *(chosen)*
- Practice exam generator for CompTIA certifications

### Why I Chose This One:
- It delivers real, actionable value to a business.
- It aligns directly with my cybersecurity career goals.
- It can be created and polished in one week.
- It’s portfolio-worthy and uses AI throughout the process.

## 🤖 Where AI Helped

### ✅ Effective AI Prompts I Used:
- “Explain multi-factor authentication in simple terms for small business owners.”
- “Create a checklist for securing a 10-person small business using Google Workspace.”
- “Generate an incident response plan for a phishing attack.”
- “List common small business cybersecurity threats with examples.”
- “Rewrite this paragraph in a more professional tone for a security document.”

### 🧠 AI Contributions:
- Clear explanations of complex concepts
- Fully formatted Markdown content
- Improved readability and professional tone
- Saved time writing templates, checklists, and guides

---

## 🧪 What Worked Well
- AI quickly generated content in a professional voice
- Prompts helped break down writer’s block
- Formatting for Markdown was easily handled
- Iterative edits with AI improved content clarity

---

## ⚠️ What Didn’t Work
- Some AI-generated content was too generic and needed customization
- Occasionally required fact-checking and human judgment
- AI over-explained basic concepts, so I had to trim redundancy
- Needed to combine multiple prompts to get the most useful output

---

## 📘 What I Learned

- AI is a powerful collaborator — not a replacement — in technical writing.
- Prompt engineering is a real skill: better prompts = better results.
- Scoping the project realistically for one week made it manageable and focused.
- Using AI allowed me to focus on structure and value, not just raw writing.

## 📦 Final Thoughts

This project helped me understand how AI can accelerate technical communication, and also helped me create something meaningful for small businesses. I now have a portfolio artifact that:
- Demonstrates cybersecurity awareness
- Shows practical application of AI
- Reflects professionalism and clarity
